			<h1>Professional Goals</h1>
			<p>In all honesty, I just want to have a stable life. I want to be able to support not only myself but those I consider family; whether they are chosen or blood family. I want to buy a house, have a family with the man I love, and to be able to travel even if it is just in the states. I also want to finsih this degree before I go on and get either a business degree or a degree in something else like teaching. I haven't thought that far ahead just yet.</p>
			<p>My absolute dream career is actually working in a muesum on fossils. I've always wanted to work on dinosaur fossils that other scientists brought back from their digs. However, there is very little money in that field and unfortunetly there is no large muesums in this state that currently have opening or field of study. I am very money motivated, I will go where the money is.</p>
